My midterm for my CMIN 220 (web foundations II) class! I am proud of this and plan to use this to showcase what I know!

I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS to make this project!
It took me about a week to finish. I really enjoyed this project and found it challenging! 

Preview here:

I am happy I did this project and it taught me that a lot goes into web apps. I need to keep working and sharpneing my skills to improve and get better!
